## A NPC character named Ethan which the user can choose to save by following certain conditions
##
## [b]Rules:[/b][br]
## - Ethan can only be interacted with once the player is within Ethan's collision range[br]
## - If the player does not have the required item to save Ethan, the player will be transitioned
## to a minigame scene where the player must run away from the monster in order to save Ethan.[br]
##
## [b]Notes:[/b][br]
## - Ethan has multiple saving conditions either by having the required item or beating the minigame.[br]
## - The global variable that saves if a kid has been saved must be altered in the minigame script in
## order to finish phases in this script.

# Things to do:
# Still need to adjust the path on how Anna goes out of the building 
# Dialogue to be added not sure if Kierra wants to put that herself or I will
# Transition to the minigame scene
# Ask Benjamin is there a losing condition on minigame
